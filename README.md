# Pomodoro Tracker App

### What is it?
Inspired by the [Pomodoro Technique](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique),
this app will time, record, and keep track "Pomodoros," which are 25-minute increments of work.
The app will also be able to provide analytics, visualizations, reminders, gamefication,
social aspects, and more, features pending.  

### Why and for whom?
The Pomodoro Technique is a popular and effective way to timebox and keep track of work,
so the addition of a rich and insightful feature set on top of a simple timer tracker will
help daily users get the most out of the technique via tools to better manage their existing
time and work. This app can also potentially help those who find themselves procrastinating
a lot or feeling rushed in terms of their day-to-day life. They can use this app to help them
reduce idling around and instead to quickly get started on their tasks. For more productive
users, having a more comprehensive system to track and analyze their Pomodoro behavior can
help them become even more productive and feel a sense of accomplishment.  

### How?
The fundamental feature of the app will be the timer, which the user can use to record their
time spend on work and rest. Each 25-minute of work is a Pomodoro, which can be named, tagged,
provided a description, and more. These Pomodoros, along with other recorded events, are then
available to view on a calendar to get a sense of how their time is being spent. The user can
also see statistics and analytics based on the Pomodoro data, receive reminders, or features
pending, earn points (or some other gamification system) and compare/compete against friends.  


### Scope
Due to the potential and flexibility of this app idea, many features, simple to complex, can
be incorporated into the product, which means plenty of work can be done for a team of 4-6.
However, it is also not too ambitious or difficult, as there are only a few core and essential
features that must be included for a basic Pomodoro tracker app.
